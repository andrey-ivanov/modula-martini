Modula Martini is a fantastic theme for Redmine by http://www.modula.fi

http://www.modula.fi/2008/redmine-theme/

Modula has not been able to maintain the theme through to the current version of Redmine.  This repository takes the last version from Modula (11 February 2009) and makes several changes and improvements so that it is compatible with the current version of Redmine and is also more usable, especially with regard to link visibility.

Bevan Rudge (bevanr), who upgraded the theme to the current Redmine version, has asked me if I would like to take over maintenance (2013-04-11).  I am glad to!  Thank you all for your excellent work.
